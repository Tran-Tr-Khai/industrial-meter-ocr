# E2 - Single Class vs Multi Class
# ===================================
# Compare single_cls=True vs keeping all original classes.
# Requires running prepare_data with --mode multi_cls first.

experiment:
  name: "E2 - Single vs Multi Class"
  description: >
    Test if single-class detection learns faster and is more stable
    than multi-class detection.
  hypothesis: "Single class will converge faster with less overfitting"
